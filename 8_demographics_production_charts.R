# This version does municipio level data first then summarizes for the states

#### R & Data Preliminaries -- (e.g. working directories, packages, functions) --- ### ----------


# this line cleans the environment, free up memory.
rm(list = ls())


### Packages (load all of them at the beginning)

# This line creates a vector of names of packages that you want to use.
want <- c("lattice","terra","foreign","RColorBrewer","rgdal", 
          "matrixStats","moments","maptools","scales","mapview", "sf","readxl","sqldf",
          "dplyr","ggplot2","tidyverse", 'tmap', 'av',"gifski","magick","stringi","caTools",
          "kableExtra","gdata","did2s","fixest")

# This line says" check and see which of the packages you want is already
# installed.  Those note loadded are ones you "need".
need <- want[!(want %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]

# This line says, if a package is "needed", install it.
if (length(need)) install.packages(need)

# This line "requires" all the packages you want.  Meaning that in order 
# to use a function that is loaded, you need to "activate" it, by "requiring" it.
sapply(want, function(i) require(i, character.only = TRUE))

# This line removes the vectors "want" and "need".
rm(want, need)


### Working directories

# This line creates an empty list, which the next few lines populate with 
# a set of file paths.
dir <- list()

# This line uses getwd() to find where your .Rproj file is.
getwd()

# This line takes this location as the "root" directory for the project.
#dir$root <- dirname(getwd()) # root directory of the project 
# getwd() is actually the directory we need (dependent on where you open project)******discuss with Steve*****


dir$root <- getwd()

# Observe the output in the console:
dir$root 

# shapefiles
dir.create(paste0(dir$root, "/shapefiles/"))

# figures directory (these line create a new folder for you to export figures)

# unprocessed data folder (this line creates a new folder for "raw" data)
